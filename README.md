# HTTPlug flex pack 

This is a Flex pack to install multiple httplug dependencies in your application. 

This package has chosen sensible defaults for you. We use Guzzle's PSR7 implementation and the curl-client
form php-http. There are lightweight packages and commonly used. You could use any PSR7 implementation and 
any HTTPlug client. Read more about this in the [HTTPlug docs](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/httplug/users.html).
